**CONTAINS COMMIT MESSAGE FOR FIRST 2 MAJOR COMMITS**

This was my first time using Github so I wasn't really sure exactly how it worked. The very first 2 commits were complete tests
and the next 2 were major commits and of me writing the code for the SortComparison class. I didn't know you had to describe each commit 
until my third (non-test) commit and I can't find a way to change the commit message so I will describe the 2 major commits here.

"First Major Changes" - In this commit I added code for the 'insertionSort' 'selectionSort' 'quickSort' and 'partion' methods in the
sortComparison class. I also added general error checking for if the list of numbers was 0 or 1 number long. In the 
sortComparisonTest class I added code for testing 'insertionSort' 'selectionSort' and 'quickSort', although they weren't correct.

"Second Major Commit" - In this commit I added code for both Merge methods in sortComparison class and test files for both those methods
in the sortComparisonTest class.
